Readme: Editing arduino.xml

the arduino.xml file contains the keywords for each type of highlighting.

If you have a personal preference that you want.. say "bool" highlighted
like a function rather than a data type*, you can modify it here. 
(* I dont know any reason why you would, its an example.)

Also if you find a standard keyword that isnt included, feel free to 
add it to your arduino.xml but PLEASE EMAIL ME too so i can include it in
the source. This way next time you download you wont need to do it again.
